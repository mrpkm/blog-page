                <p> <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.in/">Amazon Associates</a>Amazon Associates is an
                    Affiliate Marketing program that allows content Creators, website owners and bloggers to create
                    links and earn referral income when customers click the links and Buy products from Amazon through

                    as it is completely free to join and easy to use.</p>
                <p>As Amazon is one of the largest and Most popular retailers in the world, consumers are conveniently
                    buy the products Through the referal links that take them directly to the main page of the amazon
                    e-store. The commission on amazon associates varies from 0.2% to 10% as per the product description.
                </p>
                <p>There is some problem with Amazon Affiliate that it provides less commissions as compared with the
                    other affiliate programs.secondly, Amazon remembers the traffic you sent to their site if they add
                    something to their cart. Until they pay for the products, you will be remembered for 90 days, but if
                    people will visit and won't buy instantly, amazon will remember the cookie for 24 hours long. </p>

                    The Shopify Affiliate Program is a digital platform that provides support to educators, review
                    sites, influencers and content creators to educate and inspire their audience about enterpreneurship
                    with shopify and earn commission for their referrals.</p>
                <p>Shopify provides a high commission rate to their affiliates. For each referral who sign up for a paid
                    plan, you will receive a 100 percent commission on the first and second payment. It also provides
                    the 200n percent commission that applies to all plans, excluding shopify plus.This program has a
                    30-days cookie. That means when a person clicks on your link and sign up for a free trial within 30
                    days and if the user buy the paid version, you will earn a commission. </p>
                <p>This affiliate program is also very good platform but it will be quite inconvenient for someone
                    unfamiliar with deep linking as it required to deep-link their IDs to page and post URLs.</p>

                <p>this <a href="https://affiliates.fiverr.com/">Fiverr Affilate Program</a>Fiverr is an online
                    marketplace that provides digital services where individuals or companies can find freelancers with
                    a skill that can fulfill companie's or individual's need. It contains a wide range of services
                    provided by the professionals. </p>
                <p>Fiverr Affiliate program allows you to earn commission by referring products and services provided by
                    the freelancers. This program has a dynamic commission structure. You can earn the commission only
                    if someone makes a purchase through your affiliate link. The commission rate depends on the type of
                    the service that the buyer purchases. The best thing about this program is the cookie duration. If a
                    new customer clicks on one of your affliate links, you will get commission for the duration of a
                    whole year.</p>
                <p>There is one disadvantage with the program is that , if you refer Fiverr services or products to
                    people who already have a Fiverr account, you aren't going to get any commission from your referral
                    link, even if that person never purchased the products or services through that account. Otherwise,
                    this affiliate program is very helpful for those who want to start their journey of affiliate
                    marketing. </p>
